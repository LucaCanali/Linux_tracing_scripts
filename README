Title: Linux Tracing Scripts
Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch

This repository contains scripts and tools for troubleshooting and performance analysis in Linux. 
This includes dynamic tracing scripts with SystemTap both for system calls and for userspace function tracing.

DIRECTORY                        SHORT DESCRIPTION
SystemTap_Linux_IO             -> SystemTap scripts for Linux I/O tracing and latency measurements
SystemTap_Userspace_Oracle     -> SystemTap scripts for Oracle RDBMS troubleshooting and internals
                                  investigations using userspace dynamic tracing
Ftrace                         -> I/O latency histograms with ftrace

Acknowledgements:
A great number of original ideas and tools for performance investigations, I/O latency investigations and dynamic tracing come from @BrendanGregg
Many original ideas and tools for Oracle userspace tracing from @FritsHoogland

Disclaimer:
Many of these scripts provided here are experimental, may cause unwanted effect especially on busy production systems and overall may be incompabile with your current setup and need some tweaking before running.
