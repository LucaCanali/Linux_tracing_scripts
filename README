Linux Tracing Scripts
Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch

This repository contains scripts and tools for troubleshooting and performance analysis in Linux. This includes dynamic tracing scripts with SystemTap both for system calls and for userspace function tracing.

DIRECTORY                     SHORT DESCRIPTION
SystemTap_Linux_IO         -> SystemTap scripts for Linux I/O tracing and 
                              I/O latency measurements
SystemTap_Userspace_Oracle -> SystemTap scripts for Oracle RDBMS troubleshooting and
                              internals investigations using userspace dynamic tracing
Ftrace                     -> I/O latency histograms at microsecond resolution 
                              using ftrace
