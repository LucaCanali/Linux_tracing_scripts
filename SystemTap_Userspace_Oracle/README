This directory contains a short collection of SystemTap scripts for userspace probing of Oracle database processes, originally developed for troubleshooting and investigations of Oracle internals.

Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch
First release: September 2014

Acknowledgments: several original ideas on userspace invetigations of Oracle by @FritsHoogland

Compatibility and notes:
   The userspace scripts require Linux UTRACE or for more modern kernels, UPROBES. 
   This is the case of RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6.x and 7.x 
   These scripts will not work with old kernels such as RHEL 5.
   SystemTap 2.5 or higher is needed.

 Notable exception and issue with Oracle 12.1.0.2: 
   this script will throw "inode-offset registration error" when run against 12.1.0.2 on 
   RHEL/OL7.1  or higher (i.e. kernel 3.10.0-229.x). The workaround is to use an older kernel
   such as RHEL/OL7.0 (kernel 3.10.0-123.x). The issue comes from uprobes (yet to be clarified).
   No compatibility issues with Oracle versions have been reported for Oracle 11.2

The installation of Kernel debuginfo is needed for several of the scripts that also have OS probes. See details on the scripts' headers.
