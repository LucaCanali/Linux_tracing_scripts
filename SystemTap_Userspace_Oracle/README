This directory contains SystemTap scripts for userspace probing of Oracle database processes, originally developed for Oracle troubleshooting and investigations of Oracle internals.

Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch
First release: September 2014

Acknowledgments: 
  @FritsHoogland for original work and collaboration on Oracle userspace tracing.

Compatibility and notes:
   The userspace-trace scripts require Linux UTRACE or UPROBES. 
   This is the case of RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6.x (UTRACE)and 7.x (UPROBES)
   These scripts will not work with old kernels such as RHEL 5.
   SystemTap 2.5 or higher is needed.

Notable exception and issues with Uprobes and Oracle 12c
   When UPROBES to trace Oracle 12c the scripts will throw "inode-offset registration error"
   This is a problem for RHEL/OL7.1 or higher (i.e. kernel 3.10.0-229.x). The workaround is to use an older kernel
   such as RHEL/OL7.0 (kernel 3.10.0-123.x). The issue comes from uprobes (the detailed root cause is yet to be clarified).
   Oracle 11g is not affected by this issue
   
The installation of Kernel debuginfo is needed for several of the scripts that also have OS probes. See details on the scripts' headers.
