This directory contains a short collection of SystemTap scripts for userspace probing of Oracle database processes, originally developed for troubleshooting and investigations of Oracle intervals.

Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch

Acknowledgments: several original ideas on userspace invetigations of Oracle by @FritsHoogland

Compatibility:

The userspace scripts require Linux UTRACE or for more modern kernels, UPROBE. 
   They have been tested to work under RHEL/OL 6.5, 6.6, and also 7.0. 
   They It will not work on RHEL5.
   Notably the scripts requiring UPROBE  currently do not work with 
   RHEL/OL 7.1 (kernel 3.10.0-229.x.x)

The installation of Kernel debuginfo is needed for several of the scripts that also have OS probes. See details on the scripts' headers.
