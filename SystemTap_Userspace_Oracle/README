This directory contains a short collection of SystemTap scripts for userspace probing of Oracle database processes, originally developed for troubleshooting and investigations of Oracle intervals.

Author: Luca.Canali@cern.ch
First release date: September 2014

Acknowledgments: several original ideas on userspace invetigations of Oracle by @FritsHoogland

Compatibility and notes:
   The userspace scripts require Linux UTRACE or for more modern kernels, UPROBE. 
   This is the case of RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6.x and 7.x 
   These scripts will not work with old kernels such as RHEL 5.
   SystemTap 2.5 or higher is needed

 Notable exception and issue with Oracle 12.1.0.2: 
   this script will throw "inode-offset registration error" when run against 12.1.0.2 on 
   RHEL/OL7.1 (i.e. kernel 3.10.0-229.x). The workaround is to use an older kernel
   such as RHEL/OL7.0 (kernel 3.10.0-123.x). It seems to work fine on RHEL/EL 7.1 and 11g.

The installation of Kernel debuginfo is needed for several of the scripts that also have OS probes. See details on the scripts' headers.
