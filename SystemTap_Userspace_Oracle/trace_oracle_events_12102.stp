#
# trace oracle wait events in systemtap by hooking on the oracle function kskthewt
# kskthewt is called when Oracle updates the wait-related performance counters at the end of the wait.
# The register R13 is found by trial and error to be a pointer into segmented array underlying X$KSUSE 
# (roughly speaking a pointer to V$SESSION data). The offset between the value of the register R13 and 
# the value of V$SESSION.SADDR for the process/session under examination depends on the Oracle version 
# and patchset. 
# Additional scripts used to generate this script:
#    trace_oracle_events_debug.stp -> use to find the offset between R13 and the base value of X$KSSUE
#    ksuse_find_offsets.sql        -> use to find the ofssets for the X$KSUSE fields to gather/disply 
#    eventsname.sql                -> optionally use to create a sed script converting event# to event names
# Note also that registers RDI (that is arg1) is set to the timestamp value  
#      and the register RSI (that is arg2) is set to the wait event number
# 
# How to run: stap -v trace_oracle_events_12102.stp -x <oracle_pid>
# Note: if the -x option is not used this script will trace all running oracle processes
#
# Dependencies: 
#    Use systemtap 2.5 or higher
#    Kernel must have support for uprobes or utrace (this seems the case for example RHEL7.0 and 6.5)
#    The oracle executable should be in the path: add $ORACLE_HOME/bin in $PATH
#
# tested on: OL7 and Oracle 12.1.0.2
# a similar script tested on RHEL6.5 and 11.2.0.4 is available
